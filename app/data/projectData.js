      "The project is a collaboration between three universities: Dedan Kimathi University in Kenya and Carnegie Mellon University in Rwanda. The project brings together researchers, developers, and scholars to help Africa produce affordable prosthetics. The project's concept is to create a system where amputees can take photos of their stump using a mobile phone and a socket will be generated from the images. Patients can also upload photos of their remaining limbs and a prosthetic will be generated to match their existing limb. The project will also research ways to improve the reliability of photogrammetry in 3D image reconstruction and the manufacturing of prosthetic sockets to ensure patient comfort and durability.",

      xArm: `Robotics are a key part of the current and future manufacturing sector, locally and globally, as they enable increased efficiency and improved productivity. This means you produce more units per hour, making more revenue. To manufacture quality products, you need enhanced accuracy and precision, which robots provide. Robotic arms can be programmed to be precise with minimal error. This leads to higher value goods and requires skilled labour to program such systems.

Robots generally work where humans find it dangerous or in repetitive tasks. This reduces the risk of injuries for human workers and allows them to focus on higher-level tasks like programming, supervision, quality control, and maintenance.

Due to the ability to be reprogrammed, robots are very flexible and adaptable. They can adjust to production changes, handle different materials, and integrate seamlessly with other automated systems. This allows for more agile manufacturing processes and quicker product customization.`,
      virtualMechatronics: `The immersive nature of Virtual Reality (VR) makes training and skill development more engaging. It creates safe and realistic simulations of complex tasks and procedures, giving trainees better insights and making learning and practice more accessible and less expensive.

With VR, engineers and designers can model and design prototypes faster. This facilitates early-stage design reviews, identification of potential issues, and faster design iterations without the need for physical prototypes. Additionally, funders and other stakeholders have a better understanding of proposed projects.

VR allows collaboration between teams in different locations without the need for travel. Engineers can teleoperate, troubleshoot, and provide system maintenance remotely. Technicians and management can also see exactly what is happening on-site through a VR headset, facilitating accountability and problem solving.

With VR, planning and optimization can be done through the use of system digital twins. This allows for simulating production lines, testing equipment placement, and optimizing factory layouts before any physical changes are made. This reduces costs associated with physical reconfiguration and ensures efficient use of manufacturing space.`,
